This notebook contains the code I wrote to explore the Anime dataset retrieved from Kaggle that contains user item interactions recorded by Myanimelist.net. Using this data, I developed a recommender system using the Surprise Library maintained by Nicolas Hug. See the links down below for further detail and information.
